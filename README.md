I have created this project all by myself with the help of no class members, putting in enough time and hard work to get a lovely windows form for the customers who face communication difficulties at Exclsuive Books.

<h2>What this software intends to do</h2>

This application is designed to help Exclusive Books customers (especially those individuals who cannot speak and/or use sign language and those who cannot hear) search for books by providing details such as:</br>

Book Title</br>
Author Name & Surname</br>
Edition</br>
Description</br>
Fanatics Number (Loyalty Program) (if not, they may sign up)</br>
Phone Number</br>
Book format</br>
Whether they want the staff to search for a copy on our online website</br>
Whether the store has stock;</br>
and if not, whether they want staff to check with other branches and possibly order it.</br>

It allows users to store and retrieve book details seamlessly through a JSON-based storage system, ensuring fast and efficient lookups.The landing page called form1 which is displayed beautifully using relative pictures attracting the targetted audience only, different fonts and a simple background making it easy to read, follow and an interactive and colourful window form for them.
